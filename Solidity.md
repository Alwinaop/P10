# Solidity Learning and Project Resources

## Why Learn Solidity?
Solidity is the primary language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It powers decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, NFTs, DAOs, and more. Learning Solidity opens doors to blockchain development, a rapidly growing field with high demand for skilled developers.
