## Rust Learning and Project Resources

### Why Learn Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that offers performance, safety, and concurrency. It's designed to prevent memory errors and data races, making it ideal for building reliable and efficient software. Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety without a garbage collector, and its rich type system and pattern matching capabilities enable expressive and maintainable code. With a growing ecosystem and active community, Rust is increasingly used in areas like web assembly, embedded systems, and blockchain development.
